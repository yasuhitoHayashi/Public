            <li>The organism's organs have periodic movements as they move.</li>
            <li>Event camera<sup>1</sup> has the advantage of ultra high-speed time resolution.</li>
            <li>To focus only on the number of pixels based on FFT analysis would be an effective feature to identify the subject.</li>
            <li>Example of a copepod in swimming. Even if to focus only on the increase or decrease of pixels rather than the color or shape, it is possible to calculate the frequency from the repetitive motion.</li>
